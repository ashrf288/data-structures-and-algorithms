# Insertion Sort

insertion  Sort is a sorting algorithm that traverses the array multiple times as it slowly builds out the sorting sequence. The traversal keeps track of variable (temp) value and compare its value with the next  item  in the array if the temp was smaller than the next value it will swap them then moves to the next values .


the array has 2 counters i and j 
the j keeps track of the current value
the i keeps track of the next  value store it in temp variable 
 
if the current value is bigger than the previous value then it will swap these values
it will keep doing this untill you reach value which is  bigger than previous 

```
 InsertionSort(int[] arr)

    FOR i = 1 to arr.length

      int j <-- i - 1
      int temp <-- arr[i]

      WHILE j >= 0 AND temp < arr[j]
        arr[j + 1] <-- arr[j]
        j <-- j - 1

      arr[j + 1] <-- temp
```



## Trace

Sample Array: `[8,4,23,42,16,15]`


**Pass 1:**

![](/python/assets/step_1.jpg)

first  we compare the array elemnt  at index 1  `(temp)` with the previous elemnt `arr[j]` if the  temp is smaller than the preivous then we swap the values so that temp will turn from `4` to `8`.


**Pass 2:**

![](/python/assets/step_2.jpg)

now temp is equal to `23` because `i = 2`  so we compare temp with previous value (value at index `j`) which is `8` and scince the 23 is bigger than  8 it will not swap 


**pass:3**


![](/python/assets/step_3.jpg)


now temp is equal to `42` because `i = 3`  so we compare temp with previous value (value at index `j`) which is `23` and scince the 42 is bigger than  23 it will not swap 


**pass:4**

![](/python/assets/step_4.jpg)

now temp is equal to `16` because `i = 4`  so we compare temp with previous value (value at index `j`) which is `42` and scince the 42 is bigger than  16 it will  swap  and then check with previous values and stops when 16 is bigger than its previous value 


**pass5**

![](/python/assets/step_5.jpg)


now temp is equal to `15` because `i = 5`  so we compare temp with previous value (value at index `j`) which is `42` and scince the 42 is bigger than  15 it will  swap  and then check with previous values and stops when 15 is bigger than its previous value 


## Efficency

**Time: O(n^2)**

The basic operation of this algorithm is comparison. This will happen n * (n-1) number of times…concluding the algorithm to be n squared.

**Space: O(1)**

No additional space is being created. This array is being sorted in place…keeping the space at constant O(1).
