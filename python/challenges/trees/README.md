## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->

## node

[x]Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the node, the left child node, and the right child node.


## Binary Tree
[]Create a Binary Tree class

[]Define a method for each of the depth first traversals:

[]pre order

[]in order

[]post order which returns an array of the values, ordered appropriately.

[]Any exceptions or errors that come from your code should be semantic, capture-able errors. For example, rather than a default error thrown by your language, your code should raise/throw a custom, semantic error that describes what went wrong in calling the methods you wrote for this lab.
