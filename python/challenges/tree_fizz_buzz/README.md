## Feature Tasks

Write a function called fizz buzz tree

Arguments: k-ary tree

Return: new k-ary tree

Determine whether or not the value of each node is divisible by 3, 5 or both. Create a new tree with the same structure as the original, 

but the values modified as follows:

If the value is divisible by 3, replace the value with “Fizz”
If the value is divisible by 5, replace the value with “Buzz”
If the value is divisible by 3 and 5, replace the value with “FizzBuzz”
If the value is not divisible by 3 or 5, simply turn the number into a String

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

## Solution
<!-- Show how to run your code, and examples of it in action -->



created 2 function one to evalue the value of each node and the other to append the value
