<!-- Short summary or background information -->
 

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
[x]Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next node.

## Stack


[x]Create a Stack class that has a top property. It creates an empty Stack when instantiated.
This object should be aware of a default empty value assigned to top when the stack is created.

[x]The class should contain the method push

[x]The class should contain the method pop

[x]The class should contain the method peek

[x]The class should contain the method is_empty


## test ##
[x]Can successfully push onto a stack

[x]Can successfully push multiple values onto a stack

[x]Can successfully pop off the stack

[x]Can successfully empty a stack after multiple pops

[x]Can successfully peek the next item on the stack

[x]Can successfully instantiate an empty stack

[x]Calling pop or peek on empty stack raises exception


## queue

[x]Create a Queue class that has a front property. It creates an empty Queue when instantiated.

[x]This object should be aware of a default empty value assigned to front when the queue is created.

[x]enqueue dds a new node with that value to the back of the queue
